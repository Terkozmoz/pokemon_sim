## Project Name

Pokémon Battle Simulator

## Description

The Pokémon Battle Simulator is a text-based game that allows players to choose their Pokémon and engage in battles against CPU-controlled opponents. 
It's a fun and nostalgic recreation of Pokémon battles, even if it's not really finished yet.

## Installation

To play the Pokémon Battle Game, follow these installation instructions:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/Terkozmoz/pokemon_sim.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd pokemon_sim
    cd pkmsim

3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from python.org.

4. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    pip install pygame

5. Launch the game:

    python main.py

## Usage

1. When first launching the game, you'll spawn on a 8 by 8 map, with ennemies, walls and even objects.

2. Upon entering in battle,  you'll set the number of opponents you want to face in the battle.

3. Next, you'll be prompted to choose your Pokémon from a list of available options.

4. The game will start, and you'll enter a turn-based battle system where you can choose attacks, use potions, skip your turn, or even flee the battle.

5. Your goal is to defeat all your opponents and emerge as the winner. For each pokemon beaten by a pokemon, he'll level up, making it a bit stronger.
Of course, no one guaranties that this pokemon will be part of the next fight
